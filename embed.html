I hope this email finds you well.

I'm pleased to inform you that I have a first draft of the enw website to show you. I've put in a lot of effort to ensure that it meets your requirements and expectations.

Before proceeding further with the project, I am requesting a deposit of $200. This deposit will demonstrate your commitment to moving forward. I will continue refining the draft based on your feedback and make any necessary adjustments until we achieve the desired outcome.
